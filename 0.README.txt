This chip is helpful in case of an emergency(earthquake, tsunami, etc..) as it will allow people to still be able to communicate with others. Since phone and wifi services will be most likely shutdown

There is wifi that can come directly from the satellites but you will have to install a certain module for it in your home but what if you are outside how will you get help if needed? This makes our product different as it will be integrated into your phone while still keeping its slim design. 

Deals will be made with phone and laptop manufacturers to install our chip in their devices so that our services could be provided

Satelital connection will be initially based on cooperations with existing space organizations such as NASA, but we seek to eventually launch our own.
