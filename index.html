                    The VerticalChip has redefined the world of network mobility. 
                    Our chip is capable of sending and receiving data to satellites and back at a greater rate than that of the average 4G LTE network. 
                    In this regard, our system mimics the top speeds currently available and improving every day. 
                    
                    Furthermore, it must be noted that even if a user does not pay for our service, as long as they have the chip installed they will have access to the emergency protocol; 
                    phone, SMS and data access when cellular signal is down.
